1. Create home/utils.py

Inside your home app, make (or edit) a utils.py file and add this function:

from datetime import datetime, time

def is_restaurant_open():
    """
    Check if the restaurant is currently open based on operating hours.
    Returns True if open, False otherwise.
    """

    # Get current datetime
    now = datetime.now()
    current_day = now.weekday()  # Monday=0, Sunday=6
    current_time = now.time()

    # Example operating hours:
    # Weekdays (Mon-Fri): 9 AM - 10 PM
    # Weekends (Sat-Sun): 10 AM - 11 PM
    if current_day < 5:  # Mon-Fri
        opening_time = time(9, 0)   # 9:00 AM
        closing_time = time(22, 0)  # 10:00 PM
    else:  # Sat-Sun
        opening_time = time(10, 0)  # 10:00 AM
        closing_time = time(23, 0)  # 11:00 PM

    # Check if current time falls within operating hours
    return opening_time <= current_time <= closing_time

2. Test in Django shell

Run:

python manage.py shell

Then:

from home.utils import is_restaurant_open
is_restaurant_open()
