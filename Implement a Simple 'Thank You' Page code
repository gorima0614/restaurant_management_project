Step 1 : Create a Template
//thank_you.html//
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <title>Thank You | Our Restaurant</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Thnak you for your Order!</h2>
    <p>Your order has been received successfully. We'll start preparing it right away.</p>
    <p>We'll notify you once it's ready for pickup or delivery.</p>

    <a href="/">Return to Home</a>
</body>
</html>

Step 2 : Create a view
from django.shortcuts import render

def thank_you(request):
    return render(request, "thank_you.html")

Step 3 : Add a URL Route
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("than-you/", views.thank_you, name="thank_you"),
]

Step 4 : Redirect After Order Submission
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def submit_order(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
       return redirect("thank_you")
